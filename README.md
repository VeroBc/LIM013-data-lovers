## 1. Background Project

This is a project developed within my studies at the Laboratory Bootcamp in Peru.
Now we will work with data js and data api for Rick and Morty series.


## 2. Project Objectives

General:
Our site is named Rick and Morty fanpage. The aim of this website is to provide, through a friendly interface, information that generates value to users interested in the Rick & Morty sitcom.

Especifics:
* Design the app thinking and understanding the user.
* Determine the most relevant data that users want to see in the interface and why.
* Determine when users use or would use the product.

## 3. Research

Metodology and findings:
Four face-to-face interview and seven qualitative surveys were conducted with potential users. 
On one hand, a little more than fifty per cent of our sample, indicated being Rick & Morty's fan. 
On the other hand, the rest of people indicated only 'liked' it. In addition to this, a range between 21 and 26 years old was identified as an age group. 
However, when making a comparison with universal statistics, the target market that usually watches this sitcom is between the ages of 25 and 35. Therefore, combining both findings, it was established that our target includes any person, without distinguishing age, who is characterized by being 'jovial', a significant personality trait among people who meet the aforementioned age ranges.

### User Stories (UX)

User Stories' definition was based by answering main four questions:
1. What do you like/interest about Rick & Morty?
2. Have you ever searched something regarding Rick & Morty in the web?
3. If you would create your own Rick & Morty website, what would you include inside?
4. When do you consider necessary to use this website?

### Product definition (UX)

The final product at the level of experience and interface:

* The main users of the product are the fans of Rick and Morty TV series who want to know about the detailed information about the characters, episodes and locations.
* This application provides an easy and intuitive tool to search the desired information.


### User Interface (UI)

The interface allows the user to:
  * Perform the searching with immediate results without using the enter key.
  * Available pdated api data.
